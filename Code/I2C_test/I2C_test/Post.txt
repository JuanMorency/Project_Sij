Dear AVRFreak community,

I am using an Atmega2560 chip for a project and I'm trying to use the I2C hardware to communicate with a sensor. 

I used the code from the datasheet of the TWI with success for this project and I managed to communicate with my sensor, but
recently I changed fuses on my microcontroller to use an external 16 MHz crystal. After this change, it my I2C code has stopped working.

I managed to pin point the problem. It seems that even when I clear the TWINT bit to send the start condition in software, 
this bit never clears and I never get past the loop (see code). Here are the values in the TWCR and TWSR after all modifications:

Initial condition:
TWCR: 0 TWSR:F8
After initialisation:
TWCR: 4 TWSR:F8
After Start condition is sent in software:
TWCR: 24 TWSR:F8

I simplified the code and put everything in my main (note that I use an LCD to debug)


I really don't understand why this is happening, it would be of great help if someone had an idea what was causing this.
could it be a hardware problem?

I only have a voltmeter to debug, but I noticed the SDA pin on the microcontroller is always low regardless of what I do.
Is it not supposed to start high and go low while SCL is high (start condition)?

P.S. Things I have already tried:
I verified that the PRTWI bit in PRRO is at 0 to enable the I2C
